# Agent-Only Real-Time Setup for Finecons

## What Changed
✓ Removed simulated/mock devices
✓ System now relies on Python agents for real device discovery
✓ Network scanner still runs but only finds actual pingable devices

## How It Works Now

### 1. Install Python Agent on Client Devices
```bash
# Copy itam_agent.py to each device
python itam_agent.py
```

### 2. Agent Reports Real Data
- Device hostname, OS, installed software
- IP address, system uptime
- Reports every 30 seconds to dashboard
- No mock data - only real device information

### 3. Dashboard Shows Real Devices
- Only devices with installed agents appear
- Real-time status updates
- Actual system information
- Live monitoring

## For Finecons Network

### Step 1: Identify Target Devices
- Executive laptops
- Office workstations  
- Security cameras
- Network equipment

### Step 2: Deploy Agents
- Install Python agent on each device
- Agent automatically registers with dashboard
- Provides real device data immediately

### Step 3: Monitor Dashboard
- See actual devices as agents report in
- Real network discovery without simulation
- Live device status and information

## Benefits
✓ No mock/simulated data
✓ Real device information only
✓ Immediate deployment capability
✓ True network asset discovery
✓ Executive-ready demonstrations with real data
