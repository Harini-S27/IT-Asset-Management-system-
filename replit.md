2. Agents report to `/api/device-update` endpoint via HTTP POST
3. Server processes and stores device data in PostgreSQL
4. Frontend displays updated device information in real-time

### Network Discovery Flow
1. Network discovery service scans local subnets
2. Discovered devices are processed and vendor information resolved
3. New devices are automatically added to the database
4. Existing devices are updated with current network status

### Website Blocking Flow
1. Admin initiates block request through web interface
2. Server creates website block record in database
3. Router manager applies firewall rules via SSH/API
4. Status tracking monitors rule application success/failure

### Software Monitoring Flow
1. Agents scan installed software on managed devices
2. Software lists are compared against prohibited software database
3. Violations trigger automatic alerts and logging
4. Compliance reports aggregate violation data
